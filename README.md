## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation**: User and Feedback classes with private fields and getters/setters.
- **Abstraction**: Separation of logic into service and DAO layers.
- **Inheritance**: Can be used in future for extending roles (User → Admin).
- **Polymorphism**: Method overloading for operations like viewing feedback.
